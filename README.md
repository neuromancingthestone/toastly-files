API Documentation

A lot of this capstone project was learning how the Toast
API presented the data and retrieving it. 

Toast is a restaurant Point-Of-Sale system and software that
provides a POS solution to service industry businesses of
nearly any size. It is used all over the country and is
one of the most rapidly growing businesses in its field.

I own a small arcade bar, and we use Toast as our POS. I
saw a great opportunity to use live data for my capstone
project. I reached out to their API development team, and
they were kind enough to allow me access to my company's
API data.

The Toast API provides a massive amount of data to the
developer. I spent a lot of time learning how to access the
API data, and what I wanted to use from it.
